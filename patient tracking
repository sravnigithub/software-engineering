Here is an example of a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for a patient who has been hacked:

    1.Introduction
    The Patient Hacked Recovery System is a web-based application designed to assist patients who have been hacked or had their personal information stolen. 
    The system will be used by patients to report the hacking incident, recover their stolen data, and prevent future attacks.

    2.General Requirements
    2.1 Functional Requirements:-
    The following functions should be provided by the Patient Hacked Recovery System:

 2.1.1 Reporting: The system should allow patients to report the hacking incident and provide details of the stolen data.
 2.1.2 Data Recovery: The system should provide a mechanism to recover stolen data, such as credit card information, social security numbers, and medical records.
 2.1.3 Communication: The system should provide a communication channel between the patient and the support team to provide updates and receive guidance.
 2.1.4 Security Enhancement: The system should provide security enhancements to prevent future hacking incidents.

2.2 Non-functional Requirements:-
The following non-functional requirements should be met by the system:

2.2.1 Security: The system should have proper security measures to protect patient data from further attacks.
2.2.2 Performance: The system should be fast and responsive to user inputs, even during peak hours.
2.2.3 Availability: The system should be available 24/7 and have minimal downtime for maintenance.
2.2.4 Usability: The system should be easy to use and navigate for all users, even those with limited technical expertise.

1.System Architecture:
The system will be a web-based application built on a three-tier architecture. The front-end will be developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
and the back-end will be developed using PHP and MySQL database.

2.User Interface:
The user interface should be designed to be simple and intuitive for all users. It should have appropriate features for user authentication and authorization.

3.Data Management:
The Patient Hacked Recovery System should use a MySQL database to store and manage patient data, including stolen data, recovery information, and communication 
records. Appropriate measures should be taken to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

4.System Maintenance and Support:
The system should have appropriate documentation, training materials, and user manuals for all users. The system should be maintained and supported by a dedicated 
IT team.

5.Conclusion:
The Patient Hacked Recovery System is a critical tool for patients who have suffered from hacking incidents. It should meet all the functional and 
non-functional requirements outlined in this SRS document and be user-friendly, secure, and reliable.
he system should provide patients with the necessary tools and resources to report the hacking incident, recover stolen data, and prevent future 
attacks. The Patient Hacked Recovery System should also have appropriate security measures to protect patient data from further hacking incidents.

2.System Requirements:-
8.1 Hardware Requirements:

The minimum hardware requirements are:

    *Processor: 1 GHz or higher
    *Memory: 2 GB RAM
    *Storage: 500 MB free disk space
    *Display: 1024x768 resolution or higher
    *Internet Connection: Broadband or high-speed internet

8.2 Software Requirements:-
The Patient Hacked Recovery System should be compatible with a range of web browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, 
Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge. The minimum software requirements are:

    *Operating System: Windows 7 or higher, macOS 10.9 or higher, iOS 11 or higher, Android 5.0 or higher
    *Web Browser: Latest version of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, or Microsoft Edge
    *Additional Software: Adobe Acrobat Reader to view PDF files

 1.System Constraints:-
    The Patient Hacked Recovery System may face the following constraints:

 * Third-party integrations: The system may need to integrate with other systems, such as insurance providers, credit bureaus, and law enforcement agencies, 
  to provide a comprehensive solution.
 * Data privacy regulations: The system should comply with data privacy regulations, such as HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA, to protect patient data.
 * Budget: The development, maintenance, and support of the system may require a significant budget.v

 1.Glossary
    The following terms are used in this document:

    * Hacking: The unauthorized access to a computer system or network to steal data or disrupt normal operations.
    * Stolen Data: Personal information, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, and medical records, that have been stolen by hackers.
    * Recovery: The process of restoring stolen data to the patient.
    * Security Enhancements: Measures taken to improve the security of the system and prevent future hacking incidents.
